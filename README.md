# mecco_snap

Snap keeps running backups of your MODO files each time you save. It allows you to keep as few or as many temporary working backups as you like, and also to keep permanent backups with quick textual log notes. It was originally developed by Mechanical Color LLC as a proprietary paid product, and is now released as open-source under the MIT license.
